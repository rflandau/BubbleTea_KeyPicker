KeyPicker is a super simple program for viewing precisely how [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) is interpreting key inputs.

Useful for seeing what keys/modifiers are intercepted by your terminal/prompt (for example, [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) catches the alt and ctrl modifiers in many cases and VSCodium catches ctrls in its integrated terminal) and what exactly you can match on in your bubble tea environment.

Run it with `go run main.go`.
